A basic IMDb clone made with Next.js, Tailwind, and Typescript.

Makes use of API calls in order to render different kinds of results, including search queries from the user.

Features:

- responsive design
- custom error handling via not_found pages, fallback icons
- light/dark mode switching
- use of URL slugs

Full disclosure: IMDb_Clone is inspired by a base-level, "vanilla" Udemy course, but I rebuilt it with Typescript and modern (app router) Next.js, as well as using proper Next.js project structure conventions.
